## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- **home.html**: This file will be the main home page of the application. It will contain a basic layout with the necessary CSS and JavaScript for styling and interactivity. The body section of the file can include basic static content such as a welcome message or a description of the app.

- **login.html**: This file will be responsible for the user login process. It will include a form with input fields for username and password, as well as a submit button. It can also provide links or functionality for forgotten password or new user registration.

- **user.html**: This file will display user-specific information once logged in. It can include a welcome message with the username, a profile section with personal details, and other relevant content or functionality based on user roles or preferences.

### Routes

- **login**: This route will handle the user login process. It will take the username and password from the login form and perform necessary authentication against a database or other backend system. Upon successful authentication, the user should be redirected to the user.html page with an authenticated session.

- **user**: This route will return the user.html page with the user-specific information. It will only be accessible to authenticated users, ensuring that only logged-in users can access this protected page.

- **logout**: This route will handle user logout. It will destroy the session and redirect the user to the home.html page, effectively logging the user out and clearing their authentication status.
